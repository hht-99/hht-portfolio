# Project 01 - An analysis of the 'Superstore Dataset'* in Excel

---
## Project Goal: “Identify what drives profit and how we can optimise sales performance.”

In this project I highlight my abilities to use Excel proficiently when processing and displaying data.
I use the platform to extract and display the most important and relevant data. *_Dataset Available [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)_

### Data Analysis Workflow
#### Data Inspection
- Identify column types and classify them (ID, Text, Categorical, Numeric, DateTime)
- Inpsect whole dataset
#### Data Cleaning
- Convert columns to correct number format
- Perform data checks (Discount sense check, Order date ≤ Ship date, No blanks)
#### Data Manipulation
- KPI calculations
- Pivot Tables - further insights
#### Dashboard Design
- Design layout - centre around KPIs
- Sections for each of the most important areas
- Add interactive elements
- Format and clean up

#### Executive Summary

Overall, the business is profitable, but profit is highly sensitive to discounting and varies significantly across product categories and customer segments. Sales show gradual long-term growth, 
with profit growth very similar. A regression model indicates that sales volume is the main driver of profit, while order quantity and discount both impact negatively – the latter significantly. 
Despite this, forecasts show profit will continue to grow at a steady rate with no intervention. However, it is recommended to re-evaluate current discounts, or pricing, as nearly 20% of current
products produce a loss.

#### Bullet Point Summary

##### Profitability:
- Annual profit margin averages at 12.4%.
- “Technology” category is the most profitable.
- Sub-category “Tables” produced the greatest loss
- Discounts above 20% correlate with increasingly negative profit margins.
- Region “West” performs best, while “Central” underperforms.
- Top 10 customers contribute nearly 18% of all profit.
- 300 of the 1845 products sold make a loss or breakeven.
- Subcategory “Binders” has the lowest margin at -20%.
- Recommendations:
  - Consider price changes, discount reduction or removal of lowest performing sub-categories (Tables and Binders).
  - Reducing deep discounting across all products would generate greater profit growth


##### Customer analytics:
- Most valuable customers:
  - Tamara Chand
  - Raymond Buch
  - Sanjit Chand
  - Hunter Lopez
  - Adrian Barton
  - Tom Ashbrook
  - Christopher Martinez
  - Keith Dawkins
  - Andy Reiter
  - Daniel Raglin
- Consumer segment is the most profitable, but Home Office has the greatest margin.
- Most orders came from the Consumer segment, least is from Home Office.
- High value customers make 2 more orders on average than low value.
- Top 10 customers make a profit of $50,000 (18% of profit), in contrast to the bottom 10 who produce a loss of $30,000.


##### Regional performance:
- The region ordering the most is “West”, while the “South” orders the least.
- The state producing the highest profit margin is the District of Columbia
- The cities with the largest profit margins are Atlantic City and Grand Island


##### Operations:
- A shipping delay has little effect on profit; no strong correlation was observed.
